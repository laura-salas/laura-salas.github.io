                Vero,<br/>
                It's been crazily amazing to have you in my life all these years. I grew up with you first as a friend, then as someone who I looked up to more and more as years passed by. I really am thankful for having you as a second mom. <br/><br/>

                I look forward to creating new memories with you, learning from you and continue growing with you as years pass by. <br/><br/>

                Love you so, so much,<br/>
                Laura
